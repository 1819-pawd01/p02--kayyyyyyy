        <!-- HISTORY -->
        <h2><i><u>History of the Zoo</u></i>
        </h2>
        <p>The zoo was built on an old cemetary, formerly known as the Chicago City Cemetery, the final resting place of many who suffered from the cholera outbreak. The cemetary has over 30,000 corpses before it shut its gates in 1866. While the Lincoln Park Comissioners removed most of the bodies, it is rumoured that there are more than 10,000 bodies that were not exhumed. This rumor only gained more traction when the Chicago Fire in 1871 destroyed any remaining cemetery markers.Additionally, a 42-foot high bridge which stood from 1894 – 1919 which became a well-known place where people committed suicide by either jumping frm the edge or hanging themselves off the bridge. It is estimated that up to 100 people met their end on this bridge, earning it the sinister nickname of “Suicide Bridge” at the time. Lincoln Park Zoo also had bodies pop up, and one was unearthed in 1962, when a new barn was being built which would be part of a farm connected to the zoo. One body was dug up and presented to Dr. Lester Fisher, who purportedly made the rather morbid decision to just have the corpse placed right back where it was and to build the barn right over it.</p>
